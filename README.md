*A challenge provided by IQM Quantum Computers*

Team Name: Schrodinger's kittens

Hack solution:  
    created some of the improtant tools for this hackathon in `utils.py`, for analysis and explore different ansatz. I didn't go too deep in this hackathon, but I run some ansatz for the result to discuss about.

experience with this hackathon:
    proof I done everything myself, https://github.com/poig/Womanium_2022_other_challenge/tree/main/Digital-analog%20VQE
    I did try to finished three hackathon challenge myself, but only have clear solution, but don't have code. or report.
